## 1. Introduction

taosAdapter is a companion tool for TDengine, serving as a bridge and adapter between the TDengine cluster and
applications. It provides an easy and efficient way to ingest data directly from data collection agents (such as
Telegraf, StatsD, collectd, etc.). It also offers InfluxDB/OpenTSDB compatible data ingestion interfaces, allowing
InfluxDB/OpenTSDB applications to be seamlessly ported to TDengine. The connectors of TDengine in various languages
communicate with TDengine through the WebSocket interface, hence the taosAdapter must be installed.

## 2. Documentation

- To use taosAdapter, please refer to
  the [taosAdapter Reference](https://docs.tdengine.com/tdengine-reference/components/taosadapter/).
- This quick guide is mainly for developers who like to contribute/build/test the taosAdapter by themselves. To learn
  about TDengine, you can visit the [official documentation](https://docs.tdengine.com).

## 3. Prerequisites

- Go 1.17 or above is installed and CGO is enabled `export CGO_ENABLED=1`.
- TDengine has been deployed locally. For specific steps, please refer
  to [Deploy TDengine](https://docs.tdengine.com/get-started/deploy-from-package/). Please make sure taosd has been
  started.

## 4. Build

Execute `go build` in the project directory to build the project.

## 5. Testing

### 5.1 Test Execution

1. Before running tests, ensure that the TDengine server is installed and the `taosd` is running.
   The database should be empty.
2. In the project directory, run `go test ./...` to execute the tests. The tests will connect to the local TDengine
   server and taosAdapter for testing.
3. The output result `PASS` means the test passed, while `FAIL` means the test failed. For detailed information, run
   `go test -v ./...`.

### 5.2 Test Case Addition

Add test cases to the `*_test.go` file to ensure that the test cases cover the new code.

### 5.3 Performance Testing

Performance testing is in progress.

## 6. CI/CD
